Hi! 👋 We’re building Talk2Me, an affordable AI therapy solution which can serve as an on-demand, low-cost resource for crisis support, emotional expression, and preliminary mental health insights. Continue reading to learn how to run our agent!

Info on general sprint progress and individual contributions are in the `progress` folder.

# Project Setup 🤖

## 1. Clone repo

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/winsonc7/CS224G.git
```

## 2. Set up environment variables

### a. Obtain OpenAI/ElevenLabs API keys and set ElevenLabs audio agent ID

To run the agent, you'll need an OpenAI API key. You'll also need an ElevenLabs API key if testing our voice therapy solution.

### b.  Save the API keys and audio agent ID in a .env file

  Store your API keys and our ElevenLabs Agent ID (aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM) in a `.env` file. Follow these steps:

- Create a .env file

  At the root of this repository, create a file named `.env`

- Add API Keys to `.env`

  Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following lines:

  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxx
  ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxxxx
  ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM
  ```
  Replace `xxxxx` with your actual API keys.
  
## 3. Install Backend Dependencies

This project manages backend Python dependencies using Poetry. Follow these steps:

### a. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

If Poetry is not installed, you can install it globally using the following command:

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

If you run into issues, check out the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) for help.

### b. Install / update dependencies

Install all project dependencies by running:

  ```bash
  poetry install --no-root
  ```

# Run our Talk2Me app 💬:

Our app currently allows you to text our agent in a basic chatroom UI.

## 1. Start the Flask server

In your terminal, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to start the Flask server:
```bash
poetry run python backend/app.py
```
## 2. Start the UI

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```
Install the frontend dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## 3. Start Chatting!

You should now be able to chat with our agent through the UI. If the agent isn't responding as expected, double-check that the Flask server is still running.

# Run our Multimodal Agent Prototype ⚙️:

We experiment with new prompts, features, etc. using our terminal prototype in the `prototype` folder. Our latest experiments feature
voice therapy solutions using ElevenLabs APIs.

(Aside: Chat with our voice agent directly in the browser [here](https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM))

To run the agent, make sure you're in the root directory and run:
```bash
poetry run python prototype/run.py
```
From then on, follow the instructions in the terminal. Press Ctrl+C or type 'exit' to quit.

# Developer Culture 🔧
- If you’re working on a task, create an issue for it and assign it to yourself. Write updates as comments on your issue until you complete your task, upon which you can close your issue.
- If you’re writing new code, create a branch with the naming format "FIRSTNAME-BRANCH-REASON" (for example, winson-cot-prompts).
- The main branch should ideally never have any bugs, and represents our overall progress. **Commits should only be pushed to main in the cases of (1) minor bug fixes or (2) markdown file updates.**
- When you want to merge your changes to main, submit a pull request and have another team member review your code prior to completing the merge. For cleanliness, make sure to delete your branch after it's been merged.
